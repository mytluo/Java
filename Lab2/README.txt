EN.605.203 Data Structures Lab 2

README

This program was created with Eclipse Neon, with Project Execution Environment JRE System Library J2SE-1.5 (Java SE 8 [1.8.0_45]).

The package MLuoZhangLab2 consists of 2 folders, bin and src. The src folder contains the MLuoZhangMatrix.java (hereby referred to as simply "Matrix") and the MLuoZhangMain.java (hereby referred to simply as "Main") files. The bin folder contains the corresponding .class files. The src folder also contains sample input and corresponding output files in .txt format. 

Both .java files should first be compiled on the command line with javac *.java while in the src directory. Then the Main file can be run, given two arguments: the first argument being the filepath to the input file, and the second argument as the filepath to the output file (created by the program).   

The program prints out the matrix and calculates its determinant.
